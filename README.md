  # Design login page

  This is a code bundle for Design login page. The original project is available at https://www.figma.com/design/l9RiRyUVUh1IP65aJiNhAt/Design-login-page.

  ## Running the code

Run `npm i` to install the dependencies.

Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.

## Routing note

This is a single-page app. When deployed (e.g., Vercel), configure a rewrite so all routes serve `index.html`.
